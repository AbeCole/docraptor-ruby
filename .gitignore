# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc


# EB Customizations

# Ignore this so we don't see a git modified status on each test run. Currently
# the tests copy a different file into place for each ruby version, because the
# same lock file won't work with every ruby version. We want those lock files
# committed because it helps ensure the tests pass on this repo by ensuring a
# static set of dependencies is used for each ruby version. A future improvement
# could be to use docker to mount the correct lock file over top of the top
# level lock file on each docker run, but that's a future exercise.
Gemfile.lock
